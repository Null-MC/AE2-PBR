# AE2-PBR
A minimal PBR resource pack for the Applied Energistics 2 mod. This project is still a work-in-progress so not all blocks are complete.

:warning: _This pack is designed for use with AE2 on 1.20.1, and may not work correctly on other versions._

## Releases
You can find them under _Assets_ in the [Releases](https://github.com/Null-MC/AE2-PBR/releases) section.
- The "LabPBR" version is preferred, more modern, and more feature-complete.
- The "OldPBR" version is for shaders that do not support LabPBR, like SEUS.
